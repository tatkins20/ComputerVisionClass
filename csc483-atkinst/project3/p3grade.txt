Project 3:

Project 3A: Sobel and Hough 
- sobel:  30/30
- hough 35/70
- score: 65/100 - hough lines incorrectly implemented.  You didn't test your code very thoroughly and there are *no* comments I can look at to understand where your code may be going wrong.  

Notes

Project 3B: Canny
- gaussian blur 10/10
- gradient 10/10  - appears correct
- non-max 15/30 - does not appear correct, and all of a sudden you have color images?
- threshold 5/10 - it's not clear how you came up with these thresholds
- edge tracking: 15/30 - it's not clear how you tested this
- results and testing: 5/10

Total: 60/100

Notes: You didn't do a very thorough job of testing your code across multiple images, and don't have any before/after presentations to show how, if at all, any of your functions work.  No documentation in code makes it impossible to debug.
